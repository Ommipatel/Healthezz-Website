        <p>
            During the development phase of this website, it is vital that legal and ethical consideration is factored in compliance with the Australian Privacy Act 1988 and APP (Australian Privacy Principles) to protect our users and commit to organization accountability. 
            We pledge to consider regulations regarding copyright, data integrity, disclosure of handling and storage of personal data, and the right to request user’s personal data.
            We are committed to protecting and being transparent with our users by ensuring that first-time users understand and consent to our terms of service regarding the handling of personal data prior to registering for our services.
            “Personal Data” of our users may include full name, gender, age, health information, email address, phone number, location, payment details, delivery address, and order history.
            Users will be able to request an exported copy of all personal data held in our database at any point in time, in addition to being able to deactivate their account with the option to have their data removed from the site system. 
            Frequent inspection of our site's legal and ethical compliance will ensure appropriate updates are made to its terms of use and operations in the best interest of our user experience and protection of user data. 
            All data collected during the user testing and feedback process will remain confidential within the developers’ local storage and course teaching staff servers.
