    Create Account: In the Create Account webpage, it is a form that is handled to avoid errors to be sent to database. All inputs are required so you must fill them all out, or else you won't be able to fully create an account. If you accidentally make an error in one of the inputs, there will be an error presented at the top of the form in RED telling you the errors you made and need to fix. You will be notified that the account has been successfully made when a message is shown in GREEN at the top of the form.

    Dietary: In the Dietary webpage, this is where you can find information on the nutritional value of foods to gain an insight on how you may benefit or detriment your goals and help manage your diet. To use the Dietary webpage, it features a search bar at the center of the your screen. The search bar will look through our dietary database and present you information based on what you're searching for. The search bar is handled so that if you mispell a food or add a special character in the name of the food, you will be given an error message notifying you that what you searched does not exist in the database.
